Before performing an update you should take your site offline by
replacing the index.php file with a static one.

Step 1: Update your CodeIgniter files
=====================================

Replace these files and directories in your "system" folder with the new
versions:

-  system/codeigniter
-  system/database
-  system/helpers
-  system/language
-  system/libraries

.. note:: If you have any custom developed files in these folders please
	make copies of them first.

Step 2: Update your user guide
==============================

Please replace your local copy of the user guide with the new version,
including the image files.

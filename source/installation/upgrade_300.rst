#############################
Upgrading from 2.2.0 to 3.0.0
#############################

.. note:: These upgrade notes are for a version that is yet to be released.

Before performing an update you should take your site offline by replacing the index.php file with a static one.

*************************************
Step 1: Update your CodeIgniter files
*************************************

Replace all files and directories in your "system" folder and replace
your index.php file. If any modifications were made to your index.php
they will need to be made fresh in this new one.

.. note:: If you have any custom developed files in these folders please
	make copies of them first.

**************************************
Step 2: Update your classes file names
**************************************

Starting with CodeIgniter 3.0, all class filenames (libraries, drivers, controllers
and models) must be named in a Ucfirst-like manner or in other words - they must
start with a capital letter.

For example, if you have the following library file:

	application/libraries/mylibrary.php

... then you'll have to rename it to:

	application/libraries/Mylibrary.php

The same goes for driver libraries and extensions and/or overrides of CodeIgniter's
own libraries and core classes.

	application/libraries/MY_email.php
	application/core/MY_log.php

The above files should respectively be renamed to the following:

	application/libraries/MY_Email.php
	application/core/MY_Log.php

Controllers:

	application/controllers/welcome.php	->	application/controllers/Welcome.php

Models:

	application/models/misc_model.php	->	application/models/Misc_model.php

Please note that this DOES NOT affect directories, configuration files, views,
helpers, hooks and anything else - it is only applied to classes.

You must now follow just one simple rule - class names in Ucfirst and everything else
in lowercase.

********************************
Step 3: Replace config/mimes.php
********************************

This config file has been updated to contain more user mime-types, please copy
it to _application/config/mimes.php*.

**************************************************************
Step 4: Remove $autoload['core'] from your config/autoload.php
**************************************************************

Use of the ``$autoload['core']`` config array has been deprecated as of CodeIgniter 1.4.1 and is now removed.
Move any entries that you might have listed there to ``$autoload['libraries']`` instead.

***************************************************
Step 5: Move your Log class overrides or extensions
***************************************************

The Log Class is considered as a "core" class and is now located in the
**system/core/** directory. Therefore, in order for your Log class overrides
or extensions to work, you need to move them to **application/core/**::

	application/libraries/Log.php -> application/core/Log.php
	application/libraries/MY_Log.php -> application/core/MY_Log.php

*********************************************************
Step 6: Convert your Session usage from library to driver
*********************************************************

When you load (or autoload) the Session library, you must now load it as a driver instead of a library. This means
calling ``$this->load->driver('session')`` instead of ``$this->load->library('session')`` and/or listing 'session'
in ``$autoload['drivers']`` instead of ``$autoload['libraries']``.

With the change from a single Session Library to the new Session Driver, two new config items have been added:

   -  ``$config['sess_driver']`` selects which driver to initially load. Options are:
       -  'cookie' (the default) for classic CodeIgniter cookie-based sessions
       -  'native' for native PHP Session support
       -  the name of a custom driver you have provided (see :doc:`Session Driver <../libraries/sessions>` for more info)
   -  ``$config['sess_valid_drivers']`` provides an array of additional custom drivers to make available for loading

As the new Session Driver library loads the classic Cookie driver by default and always makes 'cookie' and 'native'
available as valid drivers, neither of these configuration items are required. However, it is recommended that you
add them for clarity and ease of configuration in the future.

If you have written a Session extension, you must move it into a 'Session' sub-directory of 'libraries', following the
standard for Drivers. Also beware that some functions which are not part of the external Session API have moved into
the drivers, so your extension may have to be broken down into separate library and driver class extensions.

***************************************
Step 7: Update your config/database.php
***************************************

Due to 3.0.0's renaming of Active Record to Query Builder, inside your `config/database.php`, you will
need to rename the `$active_record` variable to `$query_builder`
::

	$active_group = 'default';
	// $active_record = TRUE;
	$query_builder = TRUE;

************************************
Step 8: Replace your error templates
************************************

In CodeIgniter 3.0, the error templates are now considered as views and have been moved to the
_application/views/errors* directory.

Furthermore, we've added support for CLI error templates in plain-text format that unlike HTML,
is suitable for the command line. This of course requires another level of separation.

It is safe to move your old templates from _application/errors* to _application/views/errors/html*,
but you'll have to copy the new _application/views/errors/cli* directory from the CodeIgniter archive.

*******************************************************
Step 9: Update your config/routes.php containing (:any)
*******************************************************

Historically, CodeIgniter has always provided the **:any** wildcard in routing,
with the intention of providing a way to match any character **within** an URI segment.

However, the **:any** wildcard is actually just an alias for a regular expression
and used to be executed in that manner as **.+**. This is considered a bug, as it
also matches the / (forward slash) character, which is the URI segment delimiter
and that was never the intention. In CodeIgniter 3, the **:any** wildcard will now
represent **[^/]+**, so that it will not match a forward slash.

There are certainly many developers that have utilized this bug as an actual feature.
If you're one of them and want to match a forward slash, please use the **.+**
regular expression::

	(.+)	// matches ANYTHING
	(:any)	// matches any character, except for '/'

*************************************************************************
Step 10: Many functions now return NULL instead of FALSE on missing items
*************************************************************************

Many methods and functions now return NULL instead of FALSE when the required items don't exist:

 - :doc:`Common functions <../general/common_functions>`

   - config_item()

 - :doc:`Config Class <../libraries/config>`

   - config->item()
   - config->slash_item()

 - :doc:`Input Class <../libraries/input>`

   - input->get()
   - input->post()
   - input->get_post()
   - input->cookie()
   - input->server()
   - input->input_stream()
   - input->get_request_header()

 - :doc:`Session Class <../libraries/sessions>`

   - session->userdata()
   - session->flashdata()

 - :doc:`URI Class <../libraries/uri>`

   - uri->segment()
   - uri->rsegment()

 - :doc:`Array Helper <../helpers/array_helper>`

   - element()
   - elements()

*******************************
Step 11: Usage of XSS filtering
*******************************

Many functions in CodeIgniter allow you to use its XSS filtering feature
on demand by passing a boolean parameter. The default value of that
parameter used to be boolean FALSE, but it is now changed to NULL and it
will be dynamically determined by your ``$config['global_xss_filtering']``
value.

If you used to manually pass a boolean value for the ``$xss_filter``
parameter or if you've always had ``$config['global_xss_filtering']`` set
to FALSE, then this change doesn't concern you.

Otherwise however, please review your usage of the following functions:

 - :doc:`Input Library <../libraries/input>`

   - input->get()
   - input->post()
   - input->get_post()
   - input->cookie()
   - input->server()
   - input->input_stream()

 - :doc:`Cookie Helper <../helpers/cookie_helper>` :func:`get_cookie()`

.. important:: Another related change is that the ``$_GET``, ``$_POST``,
	``$_COOKIE`` and ``$_SERVER`` superglobals are no longer
	automatically overwritten when global XSS filtering is turned on.

*************************************************
Step 12: Check for potential XSS issues with URIs
*************************************************

The :doc:`URI Library <../libraries/uri>` used to automatically convert
a certain set of "programmatic characters" to HTML entities when they
are encountered in a URI segment.

This was aimed at providing some automatic XSS protection, in addition
to the ``$config['permitted_uri_chars']`` setting, but has proven to be
problematic and is now removed in CodeIgniter 3.0.

If your application has relied on this feature, you should update it to
filter URI segments through ``$this->security->xss_clean()`` whenever you
output them.

********************************************************
Step 13: Update usage of Input Class's get_post() method
********************************************************

Previously, the :doc:`Input Class <../libraries/input>` method ``get_post()``
was searching first in POST data, then in GET data. This method has been
modified so that it searches in GET then in POST, as its name suggests.

A method has been added, ``post_get()``, which searches in POST then in GET, as
``get_post()`` was doing before.

***********************************************************************
Step 14: Update usage of Directory Helper's directory_map() function
***********************************************************************

In the resulting array, directories now end with a trailing directory
separator (i.e. a slash, usually).

*************************************************************
Step 15: Update usage of Database Forge's drop_table() method
*************************************************************

Up until now, ``drop_table()`` added an IF EXISTS clause by default or it didn't work
at all with some drivers. In CodeIgniter 3.0, the IF EXISTS condition is no longer added
by default and has an optional second parameter that allows that instead and is set to
FALSE by default.

If your application relies on IF EXISTS, you'll have to change its usage.

::

	// Now produces just DROP TABLE `table_name`
	$this->dbforge->drop_table('table_name');

	// Produces DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `table_name`
	$this->dbforge->drop_table('table_name', TRUE);

.. note:: The given example uses MySQL-specific syntax, but it should work across
	all drivers with the exception of ODBC.

***********************************************************
Step 16: Change usage of Email library with multiple emails
***********************************************************

The :doc:`Email Library <../libraries/email>` will automatically clear the
set parameters after successfully sending emails. To override this behaviour,
pass FALSE as the first parameter in the ``send()`` method:

::

	if ($this->email->send(FALSE))
 	{
 		// Parameters won't be cleared
 	}

***************************************************
Step 17: Update your Form_validation language lines
***************************************************

Two improvements have been made to the :doc:`Form Validation Library
<../libraries/form_validation>`'s :doc:`language <../libraries/language>`
files and error messages format:

 - :doc:`Language Library <../libraries/language>` line keys now must be
   prefixed with **form_validation_** in order to avoid collisions::

	// Old
	$lang['rule'] = ...

	// New
	$lang['form_validation_rule'] = ...

 - The error messages format has been changed to use named parameters, to
   allow more flexibility than what `sprintf()` offers::

	// Old
	'The %s field does not match the %s field.'

	// New
	'The {field} field does not match the {param} field.'

.. note:: The old formatting still works, but the non-prefixed line keys
	are DEPRECATED and scheduled for removal in CodeIgniter 3.1+.
	Therefore you're encouraged to update its usage sooner rather than
	later.

****************************************************************
Step 18: Remove usage of (previously) deprecated functionalities
****************************************************************

In addition to the ``$autoload['core']`` configuration setting, there's a
number of other functionalities that have been removed in CodeIgniter 3.0.0:

The SHA1 library
================

The previously deprecated SHA1 library has been removed, alter your code to use PHP's native
``sha1()`` function to generate a SHA1 hash.

Additionally, the ``sha1()`` method in the :doc:`Encrypt Library <../libraries/encrypt>` has been removed.

The EXT constant
================

Usage of the ``EXT`` constant has been deprecated since dropping support for PHP 4. There's no
longer a need to maintain different filename extensions and in this new CodeIgniter version,
the ``EXT`` constant has been removed. Use just '.php' instead.

Smiley helper
=============

The :doc:`Smiley Helper <../helpers/smiley_helper>` is a legacy feature from EllisLab's
ExpressionEngine product. However, it is too specific for a general purpose framework like
CodeIgniter and as such it is now deprecated.

Also, the previously deprecated ``js_insert_smiley()`` (since version 1.7.2) is now removed.

The Encrypt library
===================

Following numerous vulnerability reports, the :doc:`Encrypt Library <../libraries/encrypt>` has
been deprecated and a new, :doc:`Encryption Library <../libraries/encryption>` is added to take
its place.

The new library requires either the `MCrypt extension <http://php.net/mcrypt>`_ (and /dev/urandom
availability) or PHP 5.3.3 and the `OpenSSL extension <http://php.net/openssl>`_.
While this might be rather inconvenient, it is a requirement that allows us to have properly
implemented cryptographic functions.

.. note:: The :doc:`Encrypt Library <../libraries/encrypt>` is still available for the purpose
	of keeping backwards compatibility.

.. important:: You are strongly encouraged to switch to the new :doc:`Encryption Library
	<../libraries/encryption>` as soon as possible!

The Cart library
================

The :doc:`Cart Library <../libraries/cart>`, similarly to the :doc:`Smiley Helper
<../helpers/smiley_helper>` is too specific for CodeIgniter. It is now deprecated
and scheduled for removal in CodeIgniter 3.1+.

.. note:: The library is still available, but you're strongly encouraged to remove its usage sooner
	rather than later.

Database drivers 'mysql', 'sqlite', 'mssql', 'pdo/dblib'
========================================================

The **mysql** driver utilizes the old 'mysql' PHP extension, known for its aging code base and
many low-level problems. The extension is deprecated as of PHP 5.5 and CodeIgniter deprecates
it in version 3.0, switching the default configured MySQL driver to **mysqli**.

Please use either the 'mysqli' or 'pdo/mysql' drivers for MySQL. The old 'mysql' driver will be
removed at some point in the future.

The **sqlite**, **mssql** and **pdo/dblib** (also known as pdo/mssql or pdo/sybase) drivers
all depend on PHP extensions that for different reasons no longer exist since PHP 5.3.

Therefore we are now deprecating these drivers as we will have to remove them in one of the next
CodeIgniter versions. You should use the more advanced, **sqlite3**, **sqlsrv** or **pdo/sqlsrv**
drivers respectively.

.. note:: These drivers are still available, but you're strongly encouraged to switch to other ones
	sooner rather than later.

Security helper do_hash()
=========================

:doc:`Security Helper <../helpers/security_helper>` function ``do_hash()`` is now just an alias for
PHP's native ``hash()`` function. It is deprecated and scheduled for removal in CodeIgniter 3.1+.

.. note:: This function is still available, but you're strongly encouraged to remove its usage sooner
	rather than later.

File helper read_file()
=======================

:doc:`File Helper <../helpers/file_helper>` function ``read_file()`` is now just an alias for
PHP's native ``file_get_contents()`` function. It is deprecated and scheduled for removal in
CodeIgniter 3.1+.

.. note:: This function is still available, but you're strongly encouraged to remove its usage sooner
	rather than later.

String helper repeater()
========================

:doc:`String Helper <../helpers/string_helper>` function :func:`repeater()` is now just an alias for
PHP's native ``str_repeat()`` function. It is deprecated and scheduled for removal in CodeIgniter 3.1+.

.. note:: This function is still available, but you're strongly encouraged to remove its usage sooner
	rather than later.

String helper trim_slashes()
============================

:doc:`String Helper <../helpers/string_helper>` function :func:`trim_slashes()` is now just an alias
for PHP's native ``trim()`` function (with a slash passed as its second argument). It is deprecated and
scheduled for removal in CodeIgniter 3.1+.

.. note:: This function is still available, but you're strongly encouraged to remove its usage sooner
	rather than later.

Email helper functions
======================

:doc:`Email Helper <../helpers/email_helper>` only has two functions

 - :func:`valid_email()`
 - :func:`send_email()`

Both of them are now aliases for PHP's native ``filter_var()`` and ``mail()`` functions, respectively.
Therefore the :doc:`Email Helper <../helpers/email_helper>` altogether is being deprecated and
is scheduled for removal in CodeIgniter 3.1+.

.. note:: These functions are still available, but you're strongly encouraged to remove their usage
	sooner rather than later.

Date helper standard_date()
===========================

:doc:`Date Helper <../helpers/date_helper>` function ``standard_date()`` is being deprecated due
to the availability of native PHP `constants <http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.datetime.php#datetime.constants.types>`_,
which when combined with ``date()`` provide the same functionality. Furthermore, they have the
exact same names as the ones supported by ``standard_date()``. Here are examples of how to replace
its usage:

::

	// Old way
	standard_date(); // defaults to standard_date('DATE_RFC822', now());

	// Replacement
	date(DATE_RFC822, now());

	// Old way
	standard_date('DATE_ATOM', $time);

	// Replacement
	date(DATE_ATOM, $time);

.. note:: This function is still available, but you're strongly encouraged to remove its usage sooner
	rather than later as it is scheduled for removal in CodeIgniter 3.1+.

HTML helpers nbs(), br()
========================

:doc:`HTML Helper <../helpers/html_helper>` functions ``nbs()`` and ``br()`` are just aliases
for the native ``str_repeat()`` function used with ``&nbsp;`` and ``<br >`` respectively.

Because there's no point in just aliasing native PHP functions, they are now deprecated and
scheduled for removal in CodeIgniter 3.1+.

.. note:: These functions are still available, but you're strongly encouraged to remove their usage
	sooner rather than later.

Pagination library 'anchor_class' setting
=========================================

The :doc:`Pagination Library <../libraries/pagination>` now supports adding pretty much any HTML
attribute to your anchors via the 'attributes' configuration setting. This includes passing the
'class' attribute and using the separate 'anchor_class' setting no longer makes sense.
As a result of that, the 'anchor_class' setting is now deprecated and scheduled for removal in
CodeIgniter 3.1+.

.. note:: This setting is still available, but you're strongly encouraged to remove its usage sooner
	rather than later.

String helper random_string() types 'unique' and 'encrypt'
==========================================================

When using the :doc:`String Helper <../helpers/string_helper>` function :func:`random_string()`,
you should no longer pass the **unique** and **encrypt** randomization types. They are only
aliases for **md5** and **sha1** respectively and are now deprecated and scheduled for removal
in CodeIgniter 3.1+.

.. note:: These options are still available, but you're strongly encouraged to remove their usage
	sooner rather than later.

URL helper url_title() separators 'dash' and 'underscore'
=========================================================

When using the :doc:`URL Helper <../helpers/url_helper>` function :func:`url_title()`, you
should no longer pass **dash** or **underscore** as the word separator. This function will
now accept any character and you should just pass the chosen character directly, so you
should write '-' instead of 'dash' and '_' instead of 'underscore'.

**dash** and **underscore** now act as aliases and are deprecated and scheduled for removal
in CodeIgniter 3.1+.

.. note:: These options are still available, but you're strongly encouraged to remove their usage
	sooner rather than later.

Session Library method all_userdata()
=====================================

As seen in the :doc:`Change Log <../changelog>`, :doc:`Session Library <../libraries/sessions>`
method ``userdata()`` now allows you to fetch all userdata by simply omitting its parameter::

	$this->session->userdata();

This makes the ``all_userdata()`` method redudant and therefore it is now just an alias for
``userdata()`` with the above shown usage and is being deprecated and scheduled for removal
in CodeIgniter 3.1+.

.. note:: This method is still available, but you're strongly encouraged to remove its usage
	sooner rather than later.

Database Forge method add_column() with an AFTER clause
=======================================================

If you have used the **third parameter** for :doc:`Database Forge <../database/forge>` method
``add_column()`` to add a field for an AFTER clause, then you should change its usage.

That third parameter has been deprecated and scheduled for removal in CodeIgniter 3.1+.

You should now put AFTER clause field names in the field definition array instead::

	// Old usage:
	$field = array(
		'new_field' => array('type' => 'TEXT')
	);

	$this->dbforge->add_column('table_name', $field, 'another_field');

	// New usage:
	$field = array(
		'new_field' => array('type' => 'TEXT', 'after' => 'another_field')
	);

	$this->dbforge->add_column('table_name', $field);

.. note:: The parameter is still available, but you're strongly encouraged to remove its usage
	sooner rather than later.

.. note:: This is for MySQL and CUBRID databases only! Other drivers don't support this
	clause and will silently ignore it.

URI Routing methods fetch_directory(), fetch_class(), fetch_method()
====================================================================

With properties ``CI_Router::$directory``, ``CI_Router::$class`` and ``CI_Router::$method``
being public and their respective ``fetch_*()`` no longer doing anything else to just return
the properties - it doesn't make sense to keep them.

Those are all internal, undocumented methods, but we've opted to deprecate them for now
in order to maintain backwards-compatibility just in case. If some of you have utilized them,
then you can now just access the properties instead::

	$this->router->directory;
	$this->router->class;
	$this->router->method;

.. note:: Those methods are still available, but you're strongly encouraged to remove their usage
	sooner rather than later.

Input library method is_cli_request()
=====================================

Calls to the ``CI_Input::is_cli_request()`` method are necessary at many places
in the CodeIgniter internals and this is often before the :doc:`Input Library
<../libraries/input>` is loaded. Because of that, it is being replaced by a common
function named :func:`is_cli()` and this method is now just an alias.

The new function is both available at all times for you to use and shorter to type.

::

	// Old
	$this->input->is_cli_request();

	// New
	is_cli();

``CI_Input::is_cli_request()`` is now now deprecated and scheduled for removal in
CodeIgniter 3.1+.

.. note:: This method is still available, but you're strongly encouraged to remove its usage
	sooner rather than later.

Config library method system_url()
==================================

Usage of ``CI_Config::system_url()`` encourages insecure coding practices.
Namely, your CodeIgniter *system/* directory shouldn't be publicly accessible
from a security point of view.

Because of this, this method is now deprecated and scheduled for removal in
CodeIgniter 3.1+.

.. note:: This method is still available, but you're strongly encouraged to remove its usage
	sooner rather than later.

======================
The Javascript library
======================

The :doc:`Javascript Library <../libraries/javascript>` has always had an
'experimental' status and was never really useful, nor a proper solution.

It is now deprecated and scheduled for removal in CodeIgniter 3.1+.

.. note:: This library is still available, but you're strongly encouraged to remove its usage
	sooner rather than later.

***********************************************************
Step 18: Check your usage of Text helper highlight_phrase()
***********************************************************

The default HTML tag used by :doc:`Text Helper <../helpers/text_helper>` function
:func:`highlight_phrase()` has been changed from ``<strong>`` to the new HTML5
tag ``<mark>``.

Unless you've used your own highlighting tags, this might cause trouble
for your visitors who use older web browsers such as Internet Explorer 8.
We therefore suggest that you add the following code to your CSS files
in order to avoid backwards compatibility with old browsers::

	mark {
		background: #ff0;
		color: #000;
	};

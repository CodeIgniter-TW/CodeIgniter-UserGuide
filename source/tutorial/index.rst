This tutorial is intended to introduce you to the CodeIgniter framework
and the basic principles of MVC architecture. It will show you how a
basic CodeIgniter application is constructed in step-by-step fashion.

In this tutorial, you will be creating a **basic news application**. You
will begin by writing the code that can load static pages. Next, you
will create a news section that reads news items from a database.
Finally, you'll add a form to create news items in the database.

This tutorial will primarily focus on:

-  Model-View-Controller basics
-  Routing basics
-  Form validation
-  Performing basic database queries using "Query Builder"

The entire tutorial is split up over several pages, each explaining a
small part of the functionality of the CodeIgniter framework. You'll go
through the following pages:

-  Introduction, this page, which gives you an overview of what to
   expect.
-  `Static pages <static_pages.html>`_, which will teach you the basics
   of controllers, views and routing.
-  `News section <news_section.html>`_, where you'll start using models
   and will be doing some basic database operations.
-  `Create news items <create_news_items.html>`_, which will introduce
   more advanced database operations and form validation.
-  `Conclusion <conclusion.html>`_, which will give you some pointers on
   further reading and other resources.

Enjoy your exploration of the CodeIgniter framework.

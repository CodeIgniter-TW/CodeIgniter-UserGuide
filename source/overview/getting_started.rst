################################
Getting Started With CodeIgniter
################################

Any software application requires some effort to learn. We've done our
best to minimize the learning curve while making the process as
enjoyable as possible.

The first step is to :doc:`install <../installation/index>`
CodeIgniter, then read all the topics in the **Introduction** section of
the Table of Contents.

Next, read each of the **General Topics** pages in order. Each topic
builds on the previous one, and includes code examples that you are
encouraged to try.

Once you understand the basics you'll be ready to explore the **Class
Reference** and **Helper Reference** pages to learn to utilize the
native libraries and helper files.

Feel free to take advantage of our `Community
Forums <http://forum.codeigniter.com/>`_ if you have questions or
problems, and our `Wiki <https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter/wiki>`_ to see code
examples posted by other users.

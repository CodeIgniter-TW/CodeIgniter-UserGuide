Installation Instructions
#########################

CodeIgniter is installed in four steps:

#. Unzip the package.
#. Upload the CodeIgniter folders and files to your server. Normally the
   index.php file will be at your root.
#. Open the application/config/config.php file with a text editor and
   set your base URL. If you intend to use encryption or sessions, set
   your encryption key.
#. If you intend to use a database, open the
   application/config/database.php file with a text editor and set your
   database settings.

If you wish to increase security by hiding the location of your
CodeIgniter files you can rename the system and application folders to
something more private. If you do rename them, you must open your main
index.php file and set the $system_path and $application_folder
variables at the top of the file with the new name you've chosen.

For the best security, both the system and any application folders
should be placed above web root so that they are not directly accessible
via a browser. By default, .htaccess files are included in each folder
to help prevent direct access, but it is best to remove them from public
access entirely in case the web server configuration changes or doesn't
abide by the .htaccess.

If you would like to keep your views public it is also possible to move
the views folder out of your application folder.

After moving them, open your main index.php file and set the
$system_path, $application_folder and $view_folder variables,
preferably with a full path, e.g. '/www/MyUser/system'.

One additional measure to take in production environments is to disable
PHP error reporting and any other development-only functionality. In
CodeIgniter, this can be done by setting the ENVIRONMENT constant, which
is more fully described on the :doc:`security
page <../general/security>`.

That's it!

If you're new to CodeIgniter, please read the :doc:`Getting
Started <../overview/getting_started>` section of the User Guide
to begin learning how to build dynamic PHP applications. Enjoy!

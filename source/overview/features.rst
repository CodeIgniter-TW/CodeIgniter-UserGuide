CodeIgniter Features
####################

Features in and of themselves are a very poor way to judge an
application since they tell you nothing about the user experience, or
how intuitively or intelligently it is designed. Features don't reveal
anything about the quality of the code, or the performance, or the
attention to detail, or security practices. The only way to really judge
an app is to try it and get to know the code.
`Installing <../installation/>`_ CodeIgniter is child's play so we
encourage you to do just that. In the mean time here's a list of

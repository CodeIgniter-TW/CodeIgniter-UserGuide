CodeIgniter was originally developed by `Rick Ellis <http://www.ellislab.com/>`_
(CEO of `EllisLab, Inc. <http://ellislab.com/>`_). The framework was written for
performance in the real world, with many of the class libraries, helpers, and
sub-systems borrowed from the code-base of `ExpressionEngine
<http://www.expressionengine.com/>`_.

It was, for years, developed and maintained by EllisLab, the ExpressionEngine
Development Team and a group of community members called the Reactor Team.

In 2014, CodeIgniter was acquired by the `British Columbia Institute of Technology
<http://bcit.ca/>`_ and was then officially announced as a community-maintaned
project.

Bleeding edge development is spearheaded by the handpicked contributors
of the Reactor Team.

A hat tip goes to Ruby on Rails for inspiring us to create a PHP framework, and
for bringing frameworks into the general consciousness of the web community.
